# Super-Calculator
Super Calculator is an app that gives users all the regular functions of a  calculator in addition to providing area and volume calculations 
for different shapes and objects. Essentially, it's an app that makes sure you get 100% on that next geometry test :)

## How to use it
#### Regular Calculator Mode
1. Click on the numbers or type the number out on your keyboard to write out a number.
2. Click on one of the operation buttons to select an operation. 
3. Click on the equal sign to get the answer. 
4. If you want to perform an operation on the answer, click on another operation button after you get the answer or enter a second operation before you click on the '=' button for the first. 

#### Super Calculator Mode
1. While on the regular Calculator page, press 'HOME' on the top-left corner of the screen. 
2. Select what you want to calculate for (Area=Volume, Surface Area, or Pythagorean Theorem).
3. Select what shape you would like to calculate for.
4. Enter the required dimensions using your keyboard.
5. Click 'return' or 'enter' on your keyboard once you have typed in the number. 
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all required dimensions have been submitted in which case you will be given the answer. 
7. To calculate for another object with the same shape after you have gotten an answer, simply click any number on your keyboard to reset the process.
