# Super-Calculator

## What 

Super Calculator is a desktop application made to be a students best friend. On the main page of the super calculator, there are common calculator functions in a beautiful UI.

If one exits the main page, however, they enter a page containing all the different pages including: Regular Calculator, Volume Calculator, Surface Area Calculator and Pythagorean Theorem Calculator.

If by example you click on the Volume Calculator page, you are greeted by a list of different shapes. Once you click on one, you simply provide the information it asks of you (such as radius) and it will calculate the volume. The page will also provide the formula on the top-right corner.

The same is held for the Surface Area Calculator and Pythagorean Theorem Calculator.

## How to use it
#### Regular Calculator Mode
1. Click on the numbers or type the number out on your keyboard to write out a number.
2. Click on one of the operation buttons to select an operation. 
3. Click on the equal sign to get the answer. 
4. If you want to perform an operation on the answer, click on another operation button after you get the answer or enter a second operation before you click on the '=' button for the first. 

#### Super Calculator Mode
1. While on the regular Calculator page, press 'HOME' on the top-left corner of the screen. 
2. Select what you want to calculate for (Area=Volume, Surface Area, or Pythagorean Theorem).
3. Select what shape you would like to calculate for.
4. Enter the required dimensions using your keyboard.
5. Click 'return' or 'enter' on your keyboard once you have typed in the number. 
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all required dimensions have been submitted in which case you will be given the answer. 
7. To calculate for another object with the same shape after you have gotten an answer, simply click any number on your keyboard to reset the process.
8. To calculate for another object with a different shape, then press the 'HOME' button on the top-left corner of the screen.
